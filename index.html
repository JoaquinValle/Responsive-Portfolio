                My name is Joaquin Valle Pinto I am a Mexican and Spanish student in Ithaca, New York. I was originally born in Mexico City, but have not been afraid of change. I studied high school in Switzerland and them moved to Cornell for University. I have lived in more than 6 countries and speak four languages. My purpose is for you to learn something interesting before closing this site.

                I enjoy learning. I am a proponent of doing without instruction and do not consider anything useless. From origami to blindfolded Rubik’s cubes to complex revenue management models taps into my curiosity.

                    I value a good conversation greatly. A personal connection can lead to a directed dialogue that will forever be remembered. Let me learn from you and you can learn from me.
